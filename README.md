# Grow - A Planting Guide

[deployed link coming soon]

# Motivation

I enjoy growing my own food, but sometimes I am a bit off schedule with seed planting. I created this app to help me remember when to start seeding my plants.

# Project Description

The user can sign up for an account and then fill out their profile. They will want to search and save their zipcode. This is to track the average first and last frost dates in your area, because you want to start sowing seeds at a certain time frame before /after the frost dates. Each type of plant has a different time frame for how many weeks it needs indoors. The user then can search for plants and add them to their list. Once you have a list of plants, you can see the dates that you will want to plant them.

V1: Spring sowing dates
V2: Fall / Winter sowing dates, email notifications for when to plant

Front-end:
React, Bootstrap

Back-end:
Django, Python
